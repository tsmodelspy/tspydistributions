# Welcome!

The tspydistributions package implements a number of location-scale based statistical distributions parameterized in terms of their mean and standard deviation, in addition to the skew and shape parameters.

# Installation

Currently, due to certain version requirements of the dependencies, it's best to create a new virtual environment with Python >=3.10 and <3.13, after which:

`
pip install tspydistributions
`
