The Normal Distribution is a spherical distribution described completely by it
first two moments, the mean and variance. Formally, the random variable $x$ is
said to be normally distributed with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$
(both of which may be time varying), with density given by,

$$
\begin{equation}
f\left( x \right) = \frac{{{e^{\frac{{ - 0.5{{\left( {x - \mu } \right)}^2}}}
{{{\sigma ^2}}}}}}}
{{\sigma \sqrt {2\pi } }}.
\end{equation}
$$

where $\mu \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\sigma \in \mathbb R_{> 0}$.
